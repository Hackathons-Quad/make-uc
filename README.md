## Inspiration

Financial aid is required in households with members who are not qualified for full-time job roles. Students require financial assistance for educational expenses, housewives require money for their own needs, etc.
The need to address this is the lack of availability of required resources, mindset, and cultural things. People in India do not appreciate students going for part-time jobs. Finding a proper part-time job is a task here. 

You are a young, inexperienced student who is aiming to be the best at many things. You attempt to concentrate on your academics one day, and then try to act like a "real adult" who is living on their own for the first time the next. Trying to handle everything while acting like an employee might be challenging. However, working in a part-time job as a student may be one of the best choices you’ll ever make.

## Roadblocks

The search for part-time employment is difficult. Nobody has the time or guts to inquire about whether someone needs part-timers. It is recommended for students to either acquire money from their parents or avoid spending it because doing so would make them less focused on their schoolwork. Housewives rely on their husbands for financial support, yet there are occasions when the husband's income is insufficient to maintain the home. Housewives lack the educational qualifications or background necessary to apply for jobs.
